## A

Native speakers of English exploit intonation patters in may subtle ways that are not obvious at first sight. If you speak English as a second or foreign language, these uses of intonation may have no parallel in your first language. This can lead to a breakdown in communication when a native speaker is interacting with a non-native speaker. In a conversational situation, many a non-native speaker may fail to understand some or all of that part of the native speaker's message that is conveyed by intonation patterns. The native speaker, unaware both of his or her own use of intonation and of the non-native speaker's failure to pick up on it, wrongly assumes that the message has been fully understood. Later, it becomes evident that the message has _not_ been fully understood, and neither participant in the conversation knows why.

It may well be the case that English makes more elaborate use of intonation to signal meaning than do most other languages. This is a further reason why it should not be neglected by learners and teachers of English as a foreign language.

What, then, are the functions of English intonation? We can recognize several.

- **The attitudinal function**. The most obvious role of intonation is to express our attitudes and emotions - to show shock or surprise, pleasure or anger, interest or boredom, seriousness or sarcasm, and many others. We do this by **tone**

- **The grammatical function**. Intonation helps identify grammatical structures in speech, rather as punctuation does in writing. We use intonation to mark the beginning and end of grammatical units such as clause and sentence (the **demarcative** function). We do this by **tonality**. We also use intonation to distinguish clause types, such as question vs. statement, and to disambiguate various grammatically ambiguous structures (the syntactic function). We do this mainly by **tone**.

- **The focusing** (also called **accentual** or **informational**) function. Intonation helps to show what information in an utterance is new and what is already known. We use it to bring some parts of the message into focus, and leave other parts out of focus; to emphasize or highlight some parts and not others. We do this by **tonicity** and by the placement of other accents. This is one of the most important functions of English intonation, and perhaps the function most readily taught in the EFL classroom. We combine accentuation with the choice of **tone** to present some longer stretches of the message as constituting the foreground of the picture we paint, while leaving other stretches as background. These are **pragmatic** functions.

- **The discourse** (or **cohesive**) function. Intonation signals how sequences of clauses and sentences go together in spoken discourse, to contrast or to cohere. It functions like the division of written text into sentences and paragraphs. It enables us to signal whether or not we have come to the end of point we are making; whether we want to keep talking or are ready to give another speaker a turn.

- **The psychological** function. Intonation helps us organize speech into units that are easy to perceive, memorize and perform. We can all repeat an arbitrary string of three, four or five numbers, but not a string of ten - unless we split them into two units of five. This is why we need tonality.

- **The indexical** function. Just as with other pronunciation features, intonation may act as a marker of personal or social identity. What makes mothers sound like mothers, lovers sound like lovers, lawyers sound like lawyers, clergymen sound like clergymen, newsreader sound like newsreaders, officials sound like officials? Partly, their characteristic intonation.
