A **phrasal verb** consists of a verb plus a **particle**, which may be an adverb (_away, back, together_) or a preposition that can also function as an adverb (_by, down, on, up_). The general rule is that phrasal verbs are lexically **double stress**, with the primary stress going on the particle. Thus, _,stand 'up_ has the same stress pattern as _,un'known_ or _,quite 'good_.
If the nucleus comes on a phrasal verb, the word on which this nucleus is located is therefore typically the particle.

<Naudio
  sentence="*How are you getting 'on? <br>
  The 'prisoner | *broke 'down. <br>
  The *next 'month | she *passed a'way. <br>
  I'll *get something to bring 'back with me. <br>
  *Let the children run a'bout a bit. <br>
  I'll *leave you to carry 'on, then."
  nuclei="{['on', 'down', 'way', 'back', 'bout', 'on']}"
/>
There are a few exceptions, such as _'pour down_ (= rain hard):

<Naudio
  sentence="It was *really 'pouring down."
  nuclei="{['pour']}" 
/>
