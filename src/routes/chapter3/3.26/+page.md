A **prepositional verb** consists of a verb plus a particle which is clearly a preposition: for example, _look at, send for, rely on_. These are mostly lexically **single-stressed**, with the primary stress going on the verb. Thus 'look at has the same stress pattern as _'edit_ or _'borrow_. The second element, the preposition, being unstressed, does not get accented (unless for contrastive focus). If the nucleus comes on a prepositional verb, the word on which the nucleus is located is typically the verb itself.

<Naudio
  sentence="?? Here are the photos. <br> - *May I 'look at them?"
  nuclei="{['look']}" 
/>
This happens particularly on certain constructions which leave the preposition stranded (= without any following noun phrase). Typical cases are passivization, relative clauses, and wh questions. The preposition then goes in the tail, although phonetically it retains its strong form:

<Naudio
  sentence="It *needs to be thoroughly 'looked at. <em>(passive)</em> <br>
  Are 'these the books I 'sent for <em>(relative)</em> <br>
  I *haven't got anyone to 'go with, though. <em>(relative)</em> <br>
  *Which of them can you re'ly on? <em>wh question</em>"
  nuclei="{['looked', 'sent', 'go', 'ly']}" 
/>

Again, there are a few exceptions. In particular, preposition of more than on syllables tend to be stressed: _,look 'after_ is (for most speakers) double-stressed, and so is _,do with'out_. So we say:

<Naudio
  sentence="Is there *anyone you want me to look 'after? <br>
  *What can you do with'out? <br>
  *Guess who I bumped 'into the other day."
  nuclei="{['af', 'out', 'in']}" 
/>
In any case, when there is contrastive focus, implicit or explicit, the nucleus can readily go on the preposition:

<Naudio
  sentence="We *can't leave Mary be'hind. | *Let's ask her to come 'with us. <br><br>
  ?? *What shall I do with my um'brella? <br> - Oh *bring it 'with you."
  nuclei="{['hind', 'with', 'brel']}" 
/>

There are also phrasal verbs that include both an adverbial particle and a preposition, e.g _go along with, look down on_. These are double-stressed, e.g _,go a'long with_. When one of these is the last lexical item in focus, the nucleus goes on the adverbial particle, as expected:

<Naudio
  sentence="'That argument | is one I *really can't go a'long with. <br>
  The 'maze | was *quite difficult to get 'out of. <br>
  *HTM'L | is *something I need  to find 'out about."
  nuclei="{['long', 'maze', 'out', 'L', 'out']}" 
/>
