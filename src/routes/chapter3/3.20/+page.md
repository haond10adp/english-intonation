There are various categories of word and phrase that tend not to receive the nucleus, even though they may be the last lexical item in the IP.

## A

Some nouns, for example, have very little meaning on their own: particularly vague general nouns such as things, people. Such **empty words** are usually not accented.

<Naudio
  sentence="I *keeps 'seeing things. <br>
  They're *really 'going places."
  nuclei="{['see', 'go']}" 
/>

<AudioWrapper>
<Audio 
  sentence="*What are you going to 'tell people?" 
  nuclei="{['tell']}" 
  url="3-20" 
  start=2
  end=5
/>
</AudioWrapper>
(With these, compare:
<Naudio
  sentence="I *keep hal'lucinating. <br>
  *What are you going to 'say? <br>
  They're *really 'successful.)"
  nuclei="{['lu', 'say', 'cess']}" 
/>

## B

Sometimes expressions such as _the man, that woman_, etc. mean little more than _he, she_. Like pronouns, therefore, they are not accented when used in this way:

<Naudio
  sentence="*Have a 'word with the guy. (= *Have a 'word with him.) <br>
  I *can't 'stand that woman. (= I *can't 'stand her.)"
  nuclei="{['word', 'stand']}" 
/>

## C

There are several idiomatic expressions in which _some_ is accented (often bearing a fall-rise nuclear tone), while the following noun is not. (The same pattern is lexicalized in the word _'sometimes_ and various other words beginning _some-_.)

<Naudio
  sentence="For \/some reasons, | I keep forgetting to do it. <br>
  In \/some cases, | the answer is obvious. <br>
  \/Some days | I feel very depressed."
  nuclei="{['some', 'Some']}" 
/>
This represents a kind of fossilized implication, namely a contrast with _other_ reasons, cases, days, times, etc.

## D

**Numerals** (_one, two, three_...) tend to be accented, since they have considerable semantic content. However, when _one_ is used as a pronoun - a pro-form, a kind of function word - it is not accented and so does not take the nucleus:

<Naudio
  sentence="*Can I borrow your 'ruler? | *I haven't 'got one."
  nuclei="{['rul', 'got']}" 
/>
With a plural of mass noun, the pro-form corresponding to _one_ is _some_ or _any_. When used in this way, _some_ and _any_ are not accented:

<AudioWrapper>
<Audio 
  sentence="*Could I borrow some 'sugar? | *I haven't 'got any." 
  nuclei="{['sug', 'got']}" 
  url="3-20" 
  start=5
  end=10
/>
</AudioWrapper>

<Naudio
  sentence="We *need some 'cards. | 'Can you 'see any? <br>
  I've got *lots of 'milk left, | *would you 'like some? <br>"
  nuclei="{['cards', 'see', 'milk', 'like']}" 
/>
Other words are sometimes used as virtual pro-forms, more or less synonymously with _one, some_ or _any_. They too do not get accented.

<Naudio
  sentence="\/That looks like a nice wine. I'll \buy a bottle. (= I'll \buy some.)"
  nuclei="{['That', 'buy']}" 
/>
When _one_ is used after an adjective, it is not accented.

<AudioWrapper>
<Audio 
  sentence="The *train was 'crowded, | so we *caught a 'later one." 
  nuclei="{['crow', 'lat']}" 
  url="3-20" 
  start=10
  end=14
/>
</AudioWrapper>

<Naudio
  sentence="I'll *take 'this one <br>
  Would you like a 'green one | or a 'red one <br>"
  nuclei="{['this', 'red', 'green']}" 
/>
Against this general principle, _one_ is usually accented in the expression _the one, the right|wrong|fist|last|only one, which one_

<Naudio
  sentence="(<em>Seeing an empty box of chocolates</em>) You took the *last 'one. <br>
  (<em>to someone who has just picked up a key) Have you *got the right 'one?"
  nuclei="{['one']}" 
/>

## E

The word _so_ is normally not accented when it is used as a pro-form (to refer back to an idea, situation, etc. that has just been mentioned):

<AudioWrapper>
<Audio 
  sentence="If you're *feeling un'well, | just 'say so." 
  nuclei="{['well', 'say']}" 
  url="3-20" 
  start=14
  end=17
/>
</AudioWrapper>

<Naudio
  sentence="The *band is 'popular, | and *likely to become 'more so. <br><br>
  ?? Is he *still going to 'college? <br> - I 'think so."
  nuclei="{['pop', 'more', 'col', 'think']}" 
/>

## E

As we saw above, when a form of _do_ is used as a pro-form (= as a substitute for another verb), it is not accented:

<Naudio
  sentence="*Martin got better marks than 'Wayne did. <br>
  'Peter smokes, | and his 'sister does, | 'too. <br><br>
  ?? *Will you go to 'Brighton tomorrow? <br> - I 'may do."
  nuclei="{['Way', 'Pet', 'sis', 'too', 'Bright', 'may']}" 
/>

## F

Likewise, _there_ is usually not accented when used as pro-form.

<Naudio
  sentence="'China? | I've *always wanted to 'go there."
  nuclei="{['go', 'Chi']}" 
/>
