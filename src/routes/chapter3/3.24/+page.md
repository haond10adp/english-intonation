In keeping with the general rule that the nucleus goes on the last in-focus lexical item, **descriptive** adverbs, i.e. adverbs of manner that modify the verb, do tend to bear the nucleus if they are at the end of the clause.

<Naudio
  sentence="You've *answer the questions very 'well! <br>
  She ex*pressed her views 'honestly. <br>
  He per*formed 'brilliantly. <br>
  You should ap*proach 'cautiously. <br>
  She *walks with noticeable 'limp."
  nuclei="{['well', 'hon', 'bril', 'cau', 'limp']}" 
/>
However, there are several types of adverbs and adverbial phrases that - contrary to the general rule - do not get accented when at the end of a clause. They remain out of focus. Like adverbs of place and manner, they go in tail, with the nucleus on some earlier word.

We would divide them into two lists. Those in the first list are straightforward:

- _then_ (inferential, meaning 'in that case', not 'at the time')
- _though_
- _or so, even_
- _sort of (thing), as it were_
- _a bit_
- _you know_

<Naudio
  sentence="We'll *see you on 'Tuesday, then. <br>
  The *bride look 'beautiful, | 'radiant, even. <br>
  We could *just 'stay here | and *pass the 'time, sort of thing. <br>
  Her 'heath's pretty 'poor, you know."
  nuclei="{['Tues', 'rad', 'beau', 'time', 'poor', 'stay']}" 
/>

<AudioWrapper>
<Audio 
  sentence="He had a 'heart attack last year. | It *hasn't stopped him 'smoking, though." 
  nuclei="{['heart', 'smok']}" 
  url="3-24" 
  start=2
  end=8
/>
<Audio 
  sentence="You've *got to slow 'down a bit." 
  nuclei="{['down']}" 
  url="3-24" 
  start=9
  end=12
/>
</AudioWrapper>
Those in the second list (following) tend to behave in the same way, although alternatively they can be accented, taking the nucleus in their own IP (usually a rise):

- _if necessary, of course_
- _please, thanks, thank you_
- _in a way_
- _or thereabouts_
- _for a change, for ...'s sake_
- _in fact, as a matter of fact_
- _I would/should have thought, I imagine_
- _enough_

<Naudio
  sentence="She was *rather an'noyed, in fact. <em>or</em> <br>
  She was *rather an'noyed, | in 'fact. <br>
  *How about dinner at 'home for a change."
  nuclei="{['noyed', 'fact', 'home']}" 
/>

<AudioWrapper>
<Audio 
  sentence="I'd like *four 'tickets, please."
  nuclei="{['tick']}" 
  url="3-24" 
  start=14
  end=16
/>
<Audio 
  sentence="He'll be 'off soon, I imagine." 
  nuclei="{['off']}" 
  url="3-24" 
  start=19
  end=22
/>
</AudioWrapper>

The adverb _enough_ is usually unaccented when it follows an adjective. As an adjective or noun, though, it attracts the nucleus in the usual way.

<Naudio
  sentence="*These shoes are not 'big enough. <br>
  You *haven't promised e'nough."
  nuclei="{['big', 'nough']}" 
/>

<AudioWrapper>
<Audio 
  sentence="It's *just not 'good enough." 
  nuclei="{['good']}" 
  url="3-24" 
  start=23
  end=26
/>
</AudioWrapper>
In general, the adverb _indeed_ is accented:

<Naudio
  sentence="*Thank you very much in'deed."
  nuclei="{['deed']}" 
/>
However there is one spoken idiom in which it is not accented, namely when it is used in a short response question with a fall, to show that you are surprised or annoyed by something someone has just told you:

<Naudio
  sentence="?? Quentin's won a prise. <br> - \Has he, indeed?"
  nuclei="{['Has']}" 
/>

The word _again_, when at the end of a clause, is usually accented if used in its basic sense of 'one more time', since in that sense it is often contrastive. However, it is not accented when it means 'back to previous state', nor in other more or less idiomatic uses:

<Naudio
  sentence="*Could you say that a'gain? <br>
  *What did you say your 'name was again ?"
  nuclei="{['gain', 'name']}"
/>

<AudioWrapper>
<Audio 
  sentence="*This is how to 'close it, | and *this is how to 'open it again." 
  nuclei="{['close', 'open']}" 
  url="3-24" 
  start=27
  end=32
/>
</AudioWrapper>

_Et cetera_ and its synonyms (_and so on, and so forth, and whatnot, and stuff, and things, and the like, and such like_) are usually kept out of foucs:

<Naudio
  sentence="They sell 'cards, | 'calendars, etc."
  nuclei="{['cards', 'cal']}" 
/>
