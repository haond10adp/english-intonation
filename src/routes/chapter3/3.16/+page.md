A yes-no question is a query about **polarity** (see [3.14](3.14)). A direct answer to a yes-no question involves narrow focus on polarity and the words that indicates it.

To give a direct answer, we can say _yes_ or _no_ (or use a synonymous adverb or adverbial phrase, such as _sure, definitely_ or _no way_). The nucleus goes on this word or phrase:

<Naudio
  sentence="?? Have you finished? <br><br> - 'Yes <br> - 'Definitely <br> - Oh 'sure <br> - 'No. <br> - *Not 'really. "
  nuclei="{['Yes', 'Def', 'sure', 'No', 'real']}" 
/>
The word _yes_ or _no_ (or its equivalent) may be followed by a short sentence fragment (or indeed a longer sentence) involving a verb. Less commonly, we use the sentence fragment without a _yes_ or _no_. It, too, bears a nuclear accent. In a sentence or sentence fragment used in this way, it is the operator(= auxiliary or modal verb) that shows whether the sentence is positive (_yes_) or negative (_no_). The focus is on the polarity, so we put the nucleus on the verb.

<Naudio
  sentence="?? Have you finished? <br><br> - 'Yes, | I 'have. <br> - 'Yes, | I 'have finished. <br> - I 'have. <br> - 'No, | I 'haven't. <br> - 'No, | I 'haven't finished"
  nuclei="{['Yes', 'have', 'No']}" 
/>
It is also possible to deaccent the initial _yes_ or _no_:

<Naudio
  sentence="?? Have you finished? <br><br> - Yes I 'have. <br> - No I 'haven't"
  nuclei="{['have']}" 
/>
Although the word _not_ is accentable, the _n't_ of a contracted form is not: instead, the accent goes on the stressed syllable of the word containing _n't_:

<Naudio
  sentence="?? Is that a firearm? <br> - 'No, | it's 'not. <br> - 'No, | it 'isn't. <br><br>
  ?? Can she manage Wednesday? <br> - 'No, | She 'can't."
  nuclei="{['No', 'is', 'can\'t']}" 
/>
Notice the difference between narrow focus on polarity in answer to a yes-no question and narrow focus on a noun phrase in answer to a wh question:

<Naudio
  sentence="?? Is Peter coming? <br> - Yes, | he 'is. <br> - Yes, Peter 'is coming. <br><br>
  Who's coming? <br> - 'Peter is. <br> - 'Peter's coming."
  nuclei="{['Yes', 'is', 'Pet']}" 
/>
There are various other elliptical constructions which likewise have narrow focus on the word that indicates polarity:

<Naudio
  sentence="?? D'you think they'll appeal? <br> - I'm afraid they 'might. <br><br>
  ?? Is she going to reply? <br> - I *don't think she 'will. <br><br>
  ??Are you coming out with us? <br> - I'm a*fraid 'not"
  nuclei="{['might', 'will', 'not']}" 
/>
We also get a nucleus on the polarity word in tag-like questions consisting of a verb plus a pronoun. These, too, involve narrow focus on polarity:

<Naudio
  sentence="?? We're nearly ready. <br> - 'Are you? <br><br>
  ?? They haven't taken their vouchers. <br> - Haven't they? <br><br>
  ?? You're quite wrong, you know. <br> - 'Am I?"
  nuclei="{['Are', 'Have', 'Am']}" 
/>
And the same applies to tag questions if (as is usually the case) they have their own IP:
<Naudio
  sentence="It's a *beautiful 'day, | 'isn't it? <br>
  We could *go to 'Chichester, | 'couldn't we? <br>
  They've for*gotten all a'bout it, | 'haven't they? <br>
  *Wayne didn't 'call, | 'did he?"
  nuclei="{['day', 'is', 'Chich', 'could', 'bout', 'have', 'call', 'he', 'did']}" 
/>
