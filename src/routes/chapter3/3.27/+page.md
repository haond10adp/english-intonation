Whereas adverbs and adverbial particles are usually accented (with the exceptions discussed in [3.23-4](3.23)), prepositions and prepositional particles are not. English has several words that can function both as prepositions and as adverbs, for example _in, on, by_. The EFL learner may face uncertainty over whether or not they are to be accented.

As you might expect, they are typically accented when used as adverbs but not when used as prepositions. If they are at the end of the clause, adverbs attract the nucleus but prepositions repel it.

_Adverbial particle_

<Naudio
  sentence="A *workman was walking 'by. <br>
  They in*tend to carry 'on. <br>
  The *children were running a'bout. <br>
  *Granny felt rather left 'out. <br>
  The *plane was about to take 'off."
  nuclei="{['by', 'on', 'bout', 'out', 'off']}" 
/>

_Preposition_

<Naudio
  sentence="I *haven't got enough light to 'see by <br>
  He's someone I can *always 'count on. <br>
  *What are you 'talking about? <br>
  'This matter | *needs to be 'dealt with"
  nuclei="{['see', 'count', 'talk', 'dealt']}" 
/>
Note the contrast between double-stressed _,carry 'on_ and single-stressed _'count on_. In _carry on_ the _on_ is an adverb and can have no complement. In _count on_ (someone) the _on_ is a preposition and requires a complement (= object).

Compare the verbs _sit in_ and _take in_, as in the examples _she sat in a comfortable chair_ and _she took in the information_. There are various tests we can apply to make it clear that the first _in_ is prepositional, the second adverbial. The constituents in the first example are _she sat_ and _in a comfortable chair_, but those in the second are _she took in_ and _the information_. Replacing the lexical noun phrase by a pronoun, we get _she sat in it_ (not _she sat it in_) but _she took it in_ (not _she took in it_). Lexically _sit in_ is single-stressed, but _take in_ is double-stressed. When in final position, the first does not attract the nucleus, but the second does.

<Naudio
  sentence="*What did she 'sit in? <br>
  *How much did she take 'in?"
  nuclei="{['sit', 'in']}" 
/>
It is best for learner to learn each new phrasal verb with its appropriate lexical stress pattern. There are certain useful guidelines. Those phrasal verbs that need no following object are double-stressed: _come in, fall off, crop up_. If the particle can be moved to after the object (see [3.28](3.28), then again the phrasal verb is double-stressed _take out, bring up, put back_.

As mentioned in [3.26](3.26), phrasal verbs that have two particles are double-stressed: _put up with_, _go along with_.
