A particular kind of narrow focus is **contrastive focus**. Here the nuclear accent draws attention to a contrast the speaker is making. Any following material within the same IP is unaccented and forms part of the tail of the IP:

<AudioWrapper>
<Audio 
  sentence="You *may have \/started your essay, | but *have you \finished your essay?" 
  nuclei="{['start', 'fin']}" 
  url="3-10" 
  start=2
  end=7
/>
</AudioWrapper>
