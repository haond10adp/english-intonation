## Reflexive pronoun

The most frequent use of a **reflexive pronoun** (myself, yourselves, etc.) is for emphasis, in which case, as you might expect, it is accented:
<Naudio
  sentence="I'll *write to him my'self. <br>
  He *did it all by him'self. <br>
  Will you be *able to come you'self? <br>
  She's *not very enthusiastic about it her'self. <br>
  The *villa pays for it'self <br>"
  nuclei="{['self']}" 
/>
When, however, they are used as true reflexives - as the object of the verb or after a preposition - they are not usually contrastive, and therefore not get accented. They usually form part of the tail:
<Naudio
  sentence="She feels *rather 'pleased with herself. <br>
  *Don't make a 'fool of yourself!"
  nuclei="{['pleased', 'fool']}" 
/>
<AudioWrapper>
<Audio 
  sentence="?? Have you 'hurt yourself? <br> - Yes I 'cut myself." 
  nuclei="{['cut', 'hurt']}" 
  url="3-12" 
  start=2
  end=7
/>
</AudioWrapper>
You use accented _myself_ at the end of a comment, with a non-fall tone, to suggest that this is your opinion, but that others may not share it.
<Naudio
  sentence="I *think that's right, | my\/self. (= I think that's right, | \/personally.) <br>
  I don't a\gree, | my\/self. <br>
  I'm not \sure, | my\/self. <br><br>
  ?? Do you *know /Paris? <br> - \No,| I've never \been there | my\/self."
  nuclei="{['per', 'self', 'sure', 'gree', 'Par', 'No', 'been']}" 
/>
<AudioWrapper>
<Audio 
  sentence="?? *Like a cup of /coffee? <br> - No I don't \drink coffee, | my/self " 
  nuclei="{['cof', 'drink', 'self']}" 
  url="3-12" 
  start=9
  end=15
/>
</AudioWrapper>
In informal regional English of the north of England myself in this usage is replace by _me_:
<Naudio
  sentence="I'm \mad at it, | /me"
  nuclei="{['mad', 'me']}" 
/>

## Reciprocal pronoun

The reciprocal pronoun _each other_ and _one another_ are usually contrastive, and therefore not accented:
<AudioWrapper>
<Audio 
  sentence="I think we *all ought to 'help one another." 
  nuclei="{['help']}" 
  url="3-12" 
  start=16
  end=19
/>
</AudioWrapper>
<Naudio
  sentence="At *least * Phil and Sue are 'talking to each other"
  nuclei="{['talking']}" 
/>

## Indefinite pronoun

The same applies to **indefinite** pronouns _someone, somebody, something, anyone, anybody, anything_:
<Naudio
  sentence="*Can you 'see anyone? <br>
  I've *just 'read something | *really 'funny. <br>
  I *can't keep quiet any 'longer. | I've just got to 'tell someone."
  nuclei="{['see', 'read', 'funny', 'tell', 'long']}" 
/>
<AudioWrapper>
<Audio 
  sentence="Can I 'get you anything?" 
  nuclei="{['get']}" 
  url="3-12" 
  start=20
  end=22
/>
</AudioWrapper>
The spoken phrase _or something_ (= or something similar) is unaccented when used at the end of the sentence. So are other indefinite pronouns following _or_ in this usage:
<AudioWrapper>
<Audio 
  sentence="His name was 'Jimmy, | or 'Billy, or something." 
  nuclei="{['Jim', 'Bil']}" 
  url="3-12" 
  start=23
  end=27
/>
</AudioWrapper>
<Naudio
  sentence="*Stop 'bothering me! | *Ask 'Muriel or somebody <br>
  *Can I get you a 'drink or anything?"
  nuclei="{['both', 'Mur', 'drink']}" 
/>
The indefinite pronoun can nevertheless exceptionally receive the nuclear accent for emphasis. Compare:
<Naudio
  sentence="?? A: *What the 'matter? <br> - B: I *thought I 'heard someone <br> ?? A: But there's *no one at the 'door. <br> - B: I'm *sure I heard 'something. (= not nothing) <br><br>
  I *can't 'see anyone. <em>(neutral)</em> <br>
  I *can't see 'anyone. <em>(marked negative)</em> <br><br>
  They *didn't 'bring anything. <em>(neutral)</em> <br>
  They *didn't bring 'anything. (= They *brought 'nothing.) <br>
  I *wouldn't go back there for 'anything. (= I certainly wouldn't!)"
  nuclei="{['mat', 'heard', 'door', 'some', 'see', 'any', 'bring']}" 
/>
Note also:
<AudioWrapper>
<Audio 
  sentence="We *didn't hear a 'thing. (= We *heard 'nothing)" 
  nuclei="{['thing', 'no']}" 
  url="3-12" 
  start=27
  end=30
/>
<Audio
sentence="I *won't \tell anyone. <em>(neutral)</em>"
nuclei="{['tell']}"
url="3-12"
start=31
end=34
/>
<Audio 
  sentence="I *won't tell \anyone. <em>(marked negative)</em>" 
  nuclei="{['any']}" 
  url="3-12" 
  start=35
  end=38
/>
<Audio 
  sentence="I *won't tell \/anyone. <em>(= I'll *only tell a 'few people.)</em>" 
  nuclei="{['any']}" 
  url="3-12" 
  start=39  
  end=41
/>
</AudioWrapper>
<Naudio
  sentence="I *won't tell a 'soul. (= I *wont tell 'anyone , | I'll tell 'no one.) <br>
  I *don't like 'either of them. (= I *like 'neither of them.)"
  nuclei="{['soul', 'any', 'no', 'neith', 'eith']}" 
/>
