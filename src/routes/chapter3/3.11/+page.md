## Pronouns

### A

As discussed in [3.3](3.3), we do not usually accent personal pronouns:
<Naudio
  sentence="?? *Are you going to /tell him? <br> - *Just try and \stop me!"
  nuclei="{['tell', 'stop']}" 
/>

However, we do accent a pronoun if it is placed in contrastive focus. We frequently want to emphasize a contrast between one person and another:
<Naudio
  sentence="*I'm as surprised as 'you are. <br>
  I *know how \/she feels, | but how do \you feel? <br>
  \/He was there, | but there was *no sign of \her."
  nuclei="{['you', 'she', 'He', 'her']}" 
/>
<AudioWrapper>
<Audio 
  sentence="\/They've | all \had their food. || *When do \I get some?" 
  nuclei="{['They\'ve', 'had', 'I']}" 
  url="3-11" 
  start=3
  end=7
/>
</AudioWrapper>
Although this change of person can be made explicit (= expressed openly), it is often left implicit:
<Naudio
  sentence="?? D'you /both play tennis? <br><br> - Well \/I do | but my \/husband doesn't. <em>(explicit)</em> <br> - Well \/I do. <em>(implicit)</em> "
  nuclei="{['both', 'I', 'hus']}" 
/>
<AudioWrapper>
<Audio 
  sentence="?? *What do people \think of the idea? <br> - I *know what \/I think." 
  nuclei="{['think', 'I']}" 
  url="3-11" 
  start=10
  end=15
/>
<Audio
  sentence="?? Can we *all go to the /party? <br> - \/You can."
  nuclei="{['par', 'You']}"
  url="3-11"
  start=17
  end=21
/>
</AudioWrapper>
<Naudio
  sentence="If you ask \/me, | ... <br>
  If you *want to know what \/I think, ... <br>
  As 'far as \/I'm concerned, ..."
  nuclei="{['me', 'I', 'I\'m']}" 
/>
Pronominal determiners (_my, your, his,_ etc.) may be made nuclear for the same reason:
<Naudio
  sentence="In \/my opinion | ... <br>
  From \/his point of view | ..."
  nuclei="{['my', 'his']}" 
/>
In the case of _in my opinion_ the implication is _but others may have other opinions_ or _but you may disagree_. The speaker does not need to actually say this explicitly - the contrast is implied by the choice of tonicity.
<Naudio
  sentence="<em> (discussing where to go) </em> *Let's go back to 'my place"
  nuclei="{['my']}" 
/>
In colloquial conversation the implications of marked tonicity are very frequently left without explicit expression:
<Naudio
  sentence="Did you *see what 'I got in the post?"
  nuclei="{['I']}" 
/>
-- With such implication as "Your're the one who usually gets interesting letters, but today things are different".

### B

The **complement** of the verb _to be_ regularly receives the nucleus, even if it is a pronoun. This is another common reason to locate the nucleus on a pronoun, and can often (though not always) be analyzed as involving narrow or contrastive focus:
<Naudio
  sentence="?? *Who's /that? <br> - It's \me. <br><br>
  ?? *Who'll be on \next? <br> - It'll be \you, I think. <br><br>
  ?? *Who took the milk? <br> - It was \him. <br><br>
  ?? *Who left the \sugar on the table? <br> - It wasn't \/me."
  nuclei="{['that', 'me', 'next', 'you', 'milk', 'him', 'sugar']}" 
/>
The nucleus remains on the pronoun if _it_ and the verb are ellipted (= omitted):
<Naudio
  sentence="?? *Who /that? <br> - \Me. <br><br>
  ?? *Who left the \sugar on the table? <br> - *Not \/me. <br><br>
  ?? \/Someone stole the money. || *Was it the \sales staff? <br> - I *don't think it was \/them. <br><br>
  <em>(There is a noise at the door)</em> /Peter? Is *that /you? <br>
  The *lucky \/winner | could be \you! <br>
  That's really \it. | There's *nothing we can \do <br>
  This is \/it, boys, | The *moment we've been \waiting for."
  nuclei="{['that', 'Me', 'sugar', 'me', 'Some', 'sales', 'them', 'Pe', 'you', 'win', 'it', 'do', 'it', 'wait']}" 
/>
Alternatively, the same idea can be expressed with the pronoun as subject. It is still in focus, and bears the nucleus:
<Naudio
  sentence="?? *Who's /there? <br> - \I am. <br><br>
  ?? *Who left the \sugar on the table? <br> - Well \/I didn't."
  nuclei="{['there', 'I', 'sugar']}" 
/>

### C

The general rule is that pronouns are stressed only if they are contrastive. However, there are various more or less idiomatic usages in which we focus on pronoun despite there being no obvious contrast with any other item:
<Naudio
  sentence="?? *How can I get to the \lecture hall? <br> - *Follow \me. <br><br>
  ?? Hul/lo, Roger. <br> - \Jim! What are \you doing here? <br><br>
  ?? The *year after \/next, | is going to be \difficult for us. <br> - *What do \I care? || I'll be re\tired | by /then."
  nuclei="{['lecture', 'lo', 'Jim', 'you', 'next', 'I', 'tired', 'then', 'dif', 'me']}" 
/>

English also has a number of idioms involving fixed tonicity: fossilized idiomatic expressions said with a particular information. In the following, a pronoun has a falling nuclear tone:
<AudioWrapper>
<Audio 
  sentence="*Good for \you <em>(genuine congratulation)</em>" 
  nuclei="{['you']}" 
  url="3-11" 
  start=23
  end=25
/>
<Audio 
  sentence="*Bully for \you! <em>(sarcastic congratulation)</em>" 
  nuclei="{['you']}" 
  url="3-11" 
  start=25
  end=28
/>
</AudioWrapper>
<Naudio
  sentence="*Blow \me! (= I'm very surprised.) <br>
  *Get \her! (= Look at her putting on airs.) <br>
  *Search \me! (= I don't know, I have no idea.) <em>(also</em> *Search \/me!)"
  nuclei="{['me', 'her']}" 
/>

### D

In clause final position the **possessive** pronouns (mine, yours, his, hers, ours, theirs) tend inherently to convey new information and so attract the nucleus. They are usually in implicit contrast with other possessive expressions:
<Naudio
  sentence="*Which one is 'yours? <br>
  *Give me 'hers | and *take 'his. <br>
  Our *washing machine \broke down, | but our *neighbors let us use 'theirs"
  nuclei="{['your', 'his', 'her', 'broke', 'theirs']}" 
/>

However, this does not apply to the post-modifier construction _of mine_, _of yours_, etc., where the possessive is usually not accented:
<AudioWrapper>
<Audio 
  sentence="I've *just been talking to a 'friend of mine." 
  nuclei="{['friend']}" 
  url="3-11" 
  start=28
  end=31
/>
</AudioWrapper>

## Demonstratives

Final **demonstratives**, too, namely _this, that, these, those_, tend to convey new information, and attract the nucleus:
<Naudio
  sentence="*Look at 'this! <br>
  *Who's 'that? <br>
  I'd like some of 'those, please."
  nuclei="{['this', 'that', 'those']}" 
/>

Final _there_ usually attracts the nucleus if it refers to a place that is new (= not previously mentioned), but not if it refers to a place that is given (=already mentioned or obvious from the context). When it is a post-modifier, it is usually not accented:
<Naudio
  sentence="*Hold it right 'there! <br> 
  'London's | a *long way a'way. || *How long will it take to 'get there. <br>
  *Look at that 'parakeet there"
  nuclei="{['there', 'get', 'Lon', 'way', 'par']}" 
/>
