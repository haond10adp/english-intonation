Adverbials, too, often stand apart from the basic clause structure (the clause would be grammatically complete even without them). This explain why they, too, are often given their own IP. Their behavior varies depending on their relationship to the rest of the clause.

Ordinary adverbs and adverbials - those that modify the verb or and adjective - are typically not given their own IP:

<Naudio
  sentence="She *quickly picked up the 'pencil. <br>
  We were *really 'pleased with it."
  nuclei="{['pen', 'pleased']}" 
/>
However, adverbials at the **beginning** of the clause are usually followed by an intonation break and thus form a separate IP:

<Naudio
  sentence="On *Thursday 'evening | I'm having a *dinner at 'Patsy's <br>
  *Under the 'circumstances | we've got *no 'choice. <br>
  'Technically | we *have to re'ject it. <br>
  Un'fortunately | We're *not going to be able to 'make it. <br>
  During the *last three 'years | our *budget hasn't increased at 'all. <br>
  *Only 'now | we can be*gin to see a so'lution. "
  nuclei="{['eve', 'Pat', 'cir', 'choice', 'ject', 'for', 'make', 'years', 'all', 'now', 'lu', 'Tech']}" 
/>
In the **middle** of the clause, an adverbial is often a kind of parenthesis. It may have its own IP, with separate IPs before and after:

<Naudio
  sentence="Well we 'could | 'this year | *do something 'different. <br>
  (<em>compare</em><br>
  'This year | we could *do something 'different. <br>
  We could *do something 'different this year. <br>
  <em>or</em><br>
  We could *do something 'different | 'this year.) <br><br>
  The 'rest of us, | un'fortunately, | will *have to ac'cept it."
  nuclei="{['could', 'this', 'This', 'dif', 'rest', 'for', 'cept']}" 
/>
Adverbs at the **end** of a clause maybe adverbs of manner that modify the verb and thus be integrated closely to the clause structure. In keeping with the general rule that the nucleus goes on the in-focus lexical item, such adverbs tend to bear the nucleus.

<Naudio
  sentence="She *dances 'beautifully. <br>
  I *just can't take him 'seriously. <br>
  She *spoke very 'frankly. <br>
  I'll *pay you back 'soon."
  nuclei="{['beau', 'se', 'frank', 'soon']}" 
/>
**Sentence adverbials** (adjuncts), that modify the whole clause or sentence, typically have their own IP. (For their tones, see [2.23].) They are set off from the surrounding material by an intonation break:

<Naudio
  sentence="Ap\/parently, | she's *getting di\vorced. <br>
  \Seriously, | *when do you think you'll be able to \finish it? <br>
  The of\/ficials, | sur\/prisingly, | *raised no ob\jection. <br>
  I've been *given a second \chance, | /fortunately. <br>
  I've been *talking to \Robert, | as a matter of /fact. <br>
  I'm *rather disap\pointed, | /frankly. <br>
  I'll *pay you \back, | \obviously."
  nuclei="{['par', 'vorced', 'Se', 'fin', 'fi', 'pri', 'jec', 'chance', 'for', 'point', 'frank', 'back', 'ob', 'Rob', 'fact']}" 
/>
Thus there is typically a difference of tonality in the following pair:

<Naudio
  sentence="(i) The \/king | *treated his enemy \mercifully. <br>
  We *manage to /get her | *straight to \hospital, | /mercifully."
  nuclei="{['king', 'mer', 'get', 'hos', 'mer']}" 
/>
In (i) _mercifully_ modifies _treated_, and counts as an ordinary part of the clause, both grammatically and intonationally. In (ii) _mercifully_ modifies the whole clause _we manage to get her to the hospital_, and is set off as a separate IP.

If there are several final adverbials, they are usually separated by intonation breaks:

<Naudio
  sentence="?? *What do you ad'vise? <br> - *Take it 'slowly, | with*out 'rushing, | 'calmly."
  nuclei="{['vise', 'slow', 'rush', 'calm']}" 
/>
