Sometimes statements are said with a tone other than a fall - namely, with a rise or a fall-rise. One very typical meaning of a non-fall is **non-finality**. It shows that the speaker has not reached the end of what he or she wants to say:

<AudioWrapper>
<Audio sentence="?? What did you do next? <br> - Well I *opened the /door, | and... <br> - Well I *opened the \/door, | and... " nuclei="{['door']}" url="2-6" start=2 end=11 />
</AudioWrapper>

The rise or fall-rise thus indicates that the clause, phrase or word that bears it is part of a larger structure. We analyze this tone meaning in sections 2.20-5 (sequences of tones. [Link to 2.20](2.20)).

## A

But what about non-fall tones on statements that are complete in themselves, i.e. **independent** non-falls? We analyze these tone meanings in the sections that follow now.

The most most typical meaning of fall-rise tone is that the speaker _implies_ something without necessarily putting it into words. We call this tone meaning the **implicational fall-rise**.

By making a statement with the fall-rise, the speaker typically states one thing but implies something further. Something is left unsaid - perhaps some kind of reservation or implication:
<AudioWrapper>
<Audio sentence="?? Who's that? <br> - Well I *know her \/face." nuclei="{['face']}" url="2-6" start=12 end=16 />
</AudioWrapper>

## B

The fall-rise implies something further: a **contrast** between what is expressed and what has not, or not yet, been expressed. In this case it might be:
<Naudio sentence="- Well I *know her \/face. | but I *can't remember her \name." nuclei="{['face', 'name']}" />
The speaker has the choice of making the contrast explicit, as in the second version, or leaving it implicit, as in the first. Whether explicit or implicit, the implication is still hinted at by the fall-rise intonation.

The unexpressed implication can usually be formulated in a clause beginning _but..._, which could make it explicit. The implicational fall-rise can be thought of as the tone that signals a _but..._ to come.

More than one implication may be possible:
<AudioWrapper>
<Audio sentence="?? Can we fix an appointment? <br> - I could *see you on \/Wednesday" nuclei="{['Wed']}" url="2-6" start=17 end=23 />
</AudioWrapper>
Making it explicit we might have:
<Naudio sentence="- I could *see you on \Wednesday, | but *not on \Thursday. or <br> - I could *see you on \/Wednesday, | but *that might not suit \you." nuclei="{['Wed', 'Thurs', 'you']}" />
Using a fall-rise but leaving the reservation unexpressed may lead the other speaker to pick up on the implication and ask for the reservation to be spelt out:
<AudioWrapper>
<Audio sentence="A: *What can we have for \tea? <br> B: Well we've *got some \/strawberries. <br> A: So *what's the \problem? <br> B: We *haven't got any \cream." nuclei="{['tea', 'straw', 'prob', 'cream']}" url="2-6" start=24 end=33 />
</AudioWrapper>

<Naudio sentence="A: *What d'you think of \Hubert? <br> B: He's *very me\/ticulous. <br> A: /But...? <br> B: *Utterly \boring." nuclei="{['Hub', 'tic', 'But', 'bor']}" />
The American gun lobby has a slogan: 
<Naudio sentence="\/Guns don't kill people, | \/people kill people" nuclei="{['Guns', 'peo']}" />

-- where there is an explicit contrast between _guns_ and _people_ (as the subject of _kill_). The idea could be expressed more subtly (but still as tendentiously) by saying just:
<Naudio sentence="\/Guns don't kill people." nuclei="{['Guns']}" />

-- leaving it to the fall-rise to imply the corollary without expressing it.

## C

A speaker who uses a fall-rise has **reservations** about what is said. The speaker's statement may be true under some conditions, _but_ not under others. Again, the reservation may or may not be made explicit. In the following examples it is given in parentheses: the words in parentheses might or might not be spoken aloud.
<AudioWrapper>
<Audio sentence="?? Can we fix a date for the meeting? <br> - Well we could *try \/Monday (| though *not if that's \/difficult for you) " nuclei="{['Mon','dif']}" url="2-6" start=33 end=41 />
</AudioWrapper>
<Naudio sentence="?? Have you ever visited France? <br> - I've *been to \/Paris (| but *not to many \/other parts of the country). <br><br> ?? Is fruit expensive in this country? <br> - Well \/apples are (| but I'm *not sure about \/other kinds of fruit). <br><br> ?? Is it an attractive building? <br> - Well \/I think so (| but *others may not a\gree) " nuclei="{['Par', 'oth', 'app', 'I', 'gree']}" />
The implicational fall-rise enables us to imply things without actually saying them. It makes it possible to be tactful and politely indirect; it also makes it possible to be hypocritical and devious.
<Naudio sentence="?? Are you free next week? <br> - Well on \/Monday I am (| but *later I may \not be). <br><br> ?? Do you smoke? <br> - I *do oc\/casionally(| but not \/regularly)." nuclei="{['Mon', 'not', 'ca', 'reg']}" />
<AudioWrapper>
<Audio sentence="?? What's she like as a colleague? <br> - Well she \/works very hard" nuclei="{['works']}" url="2-6" start=41 end=46 />
</AudioWrapper>
In the last example the unspoken implication might be _but she has no imagination_ or _but she's not a good teacher_ or _but she doesn't get on with her colleagues_ or something else uncomplimentary.

There is an English expression (with, by the way, difficult-to-explain tonicity in the second intonation phrase):
<Naudio sentence="It's *not what she \/said, | but the *way that she \said it" nuclei="{['said']}" />
This suggests that the words if written might have been unexceptionable; but as spoken their intonation implied something different. They probably had a fall-rise
