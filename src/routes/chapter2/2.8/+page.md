In English - unlike Spanish or Greek, for example - yes-no questions usually have a special interrogative grammatical form, involving the inversion of the subject and the verb. We discuss their intonation in [2.13](2.13). However, we do also sometimes use **declarative questions**, which are grammatically like statements. They can be identified as questions only by their intonation, or by the pragmatics of the situation where they are used. They are usually said with a rise: a **yes-no rise**.
<AudioWrapper>
<Audio sentence="You'll be coming to /dinner? (= Are you coming to dinner?)" nuclei="{['din']}" url="2-8" start=1 end=4 />
<Audio sentence="He *took his /passport? (= Did he take his passport?)" nuclei="{['pass']}" url="2-8" start=4 end=6 />
</AudioWrapper>
<Naudio sentence="You *think I'm /crazy (= Do you think I'm crazy?) <br><br> ?? I had an a*mazing ex\perience <br> - You /did? (= I hear what you say.)" nuclei="{['craz', 'pe', 'did']}" />

Sometimes they are said with a **fall-rise**:
<AudioWrapper>
<Audio sentence="You *didn't go and \/tell him? (= Does that mean that you told him?)" nuclei="{['tell']}" url="2-8" start=6 end=9 />
</AudioWrapper>
and sometimes, confusingly, with a **fall**:
<AudioWrapper>
<Audio sentence="So we'll be *free by \six, then? (= Do you mean we'll free by six?)" nuclei="{['six']}" url="2-8" start=9 end=11 />
</AudioWrapper>
<Naudio sentence="You mean he *didn't turn \up?" nuclei="{['up']}" />
It can be difficult for the hearer to know whether a question or a statement is intended, particularly when a falling tone is used:
<AudioWrapper>
<Audio sentence="?? So there were \three of them <br> - Are you /asking me | or \telling me" nuclei="{['three', 'ask', 'tell']}" url="2-8" start=11 end=15 />
</AudioWrapper>
