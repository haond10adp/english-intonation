In English - unlike Spanish or Greek, for example - yes-no questions usually have a special interrogative grammatical form, involving the inversion of the subject and the verb. We discuss their intonation in [2.13](2.13). However, we do also sometimes use **declarative questions**, which are grammatically like statements. They can be identified as questions only by their intonation, or by the pragmatics of the situation where they are used. They are usually said with a rise: a **yes-no rise**.
