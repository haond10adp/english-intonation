The fall-rise can also be used to signal that the speaker is **tentative** about what he or she says. This is a special case of the implicational fall-rise: the speaker makes a statement but at the same time implies something like _but I'm not sure_ or _but I don't want to commit myself to this._
<Naudio sentence="?? Is this the way to Holborn? <br> - I \/think so (| but I'm not quite \sure). <br><br> ?? What shall we have to drink? <br> - We *could try a \/riesling." nuclei="{['think', 'sure', 'ries']}" />

## Polite corrections

If we think someone has made a mistake, and we want to correct them, it is polite to do so in a tentative way. This explains the use of the fall-rise for **polite corrections**.
<AudioWrapper>
<Audio sentence="?? She's coming on Wednesday. <br> - On \/Thursday" nuclei="{['Thurs']}" url="2-7" start=2 end=6 />
</AudioWrapper>
<Naudio sentence="?? How many students? <br> - \/Thirty. <br><br> ?? I'll come with you <br> - No you \/won't" nuclei="{['Thir', 'won\'t']}" />
In contrast, to use a falling tone for a correction would be abrupt and perhaps rude:
<AudioWrapper>
<Audio sentence="?? She's coming on Wednesday. <br> - \No, | on \Thursday" nuclei="{['No', 'Thurs']}" url="2-7" start=7 end=11 />
</AudioWrapper>

## Partial statements

The fall-rise is often used when we want to make a **partial** statement; that is, to say that something applies partly, to some extent, but not completely:
<Naudio sentence="?? So you both live in London? <br> - \/I do (| but *Mary lives in \York)." nuclei="{['I', 'York']}" />
<AudioWrapper>
<Audio sentence="?? What was the food like? <br> - Well the \/fish was good." nuclei="{['fish']}" url="2-7" start=11 end=16 />
</AudioWrapper>
Many corrections are like this: partly we agree with the other speaker, partly we disagree. Partial corrections, too, take a fall-rise:
<Naudio sentence="?? I hear you passed all your exams. <br> - \/Most of them. <br> - Well not \/all of them." nuclei="{['Most', 'all']}" />
<AudioWrapper>
<Audio sentence="?? Green and blue are primary colors. <br> - Well \/blue is (| but \/green isn't)" nuclei="{['blue', 'green']}" url="2-7" start=16 end=21 />
</AudioWrapper>

## Negative statements

The fall-rise is often used in **negative** statements:
<Naudio sentence="She *wasn't very \/pleased. <br>I'm *not suggesting these *changes will be very \/easy. " nuclei="{['pleased', 'ea']}" />
<AudioWrapper>
<Audio sentence="I *don't want to sound \/rude (| but is *that your /dog?)" nuclei="{['rude', 'dog']}" url="2-7" start=37 end=41 />
</AudioWrapper>
<Naudio sentence="?? She refused to pay. <br> - Oh I *don't think that's \/true" nuclei="{['true']}" />
<AudioWrapper>
<Audio sentence="?? Why are you complaining? <br> - It's not just \/me. (\Others are, | too.)" nuclei="{['me', 'Oth', 'too']}" url="2-7" start=42 end=47 />
</AudioWrapper>
<Naudio sentence="?? Are you free over the weekend? <br> - Not on \/Saturday (though I am on \/Sunday)." nuclei="{['Sat', 'Sun']}" />
The implication is that the corresponding positive statement is not true. There is a contrast, implicit or explicit, between a negative (something that we present as not true) and positive (something we present as true). The negative part is said with a fall-rise tone. The positive part may either left implicit (unexpressed), or else be made explicit by being put into words. If it is made explicit, it may come either before or after the negative part, and may have either a definitive fall or an implicational (polite-correction) fall-rise:
<Naudio sentence="?? He says they're moving to London <br><br> - Not \/London. <br> - He *didn't say \/London. <br> - He *didn't say \/London, | he said \Manchester. <br> - He said \Manchester, | *not \/London." nuclei="{['Lon', 'Man']}" />
<AudioWrapper>
<Audio sentence="She *didn't say she \/would do it (, | she said she \wouldn't)." nuclei="{['would']}" url="2-7" start=48 end=52 />
<Audio sentence="She said that she \wouldn't do it, | *not that she \/would." nuclei="{['would']}" url="2-7" start=53 end=57 />
</AudioWrapper>

### Scope of negation

Let us return to one of our earlier examples of the implicational fall-rise. There are two ways in which the implication might be made explicit:
<Naudio sentence="?? Can we fix an appointment? <br> - (i) Well I could *see you on \/Wednesday | but on *Thursday I'm \busy. <br> - (ii)  Well I could *see you \/Wednesday | but *not on \/Thursday" nuclei="{['Wed', 'busy', 'Thurs']}" />
In (i) the implication is spelt out positively , with a definitive fall on _busy_, but in (ii) it is expressed negatively, with a negative fall-rise on _Thursday_. Consider the likely tone choices in the following answers. The positive answer would probably have a fall, the negative one a fall-rise.
<AudioWrapper>
<Audio sentence="?? How did it go? <br> - (<em>positive</em>) Oh it was 'very suc\cessful. <br> - (<em>negative</em>) Well I *wouldn't say it was suc\/cessful." nuclei="{['cess']}" url="2-7" start=59 end=70 />
</AudioWrapper>
<Naudio sentence="?? Have you been to the Gigolo Club? <br> - <em>(positive)</em> Yes I've had some *great \times there. <br> - <em>(negative)</em> *Not since it re\/opened" nuclei="{['times', 'o']}" />
The fall-rise has a special function in a negative sentence. Namely, it indicates that the **scope** of negation includes the word bearing the nucleus, but not the main verb (unless the main verb itself bears the nucleus). A falling tone, on the other hand, does not restrict the scope of the negation in this way. In the following examples labelled (i), the fall means the scope is not limited; in those labelled (ii), the fall-rise means it is limited. The on labelled (iii), which has a rise, is ambiguous.
<Naudio sentence="(i) I *won't eat \anything. (= I'll eat nothing.) <br>(ii) I *wont eat \/anything. (= I'll eat only certain things.) <br> (iii) 'Will he eat /anything?" nuclei="{['any']}" />
<AudioWrapper>
<Audio sentence="(i) She *didn't do it because she was \/tired. (= She did it, but for some other reason.)" nuclei="{['tired']}" url="2-7" start=70 end=74 />
<Audio sentence="(ii) She *didn't \/do it | because she was \tired. (= She didn't do it. Here's why.)" nuclei="{['do', 'tired']}" url="2-7" start=75 end=78 />
</AudioWrapper>
