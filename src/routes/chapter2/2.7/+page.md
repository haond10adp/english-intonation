The fall-rise can also be used to signal that the speaker is **tentative** about what he or she says. This is a special case of the implicational fall-rise: the speaker makes a statement but at the same time implies something like _but I'm not sure_ or _but I don't want to commit myself to this._
<Naudio sentence="?? Is this the way to Holborn? <br> - I \/think so (| but I'm not quite \sure). <br><br> ?? What shall we have to drink? <br> - We *could try a \/riesling." nuclei="{['think', 'sure', 'ries']}" />

## A

If we think someone has made a mistake, and we want to correct them, it is polite to do so in a tentative way. This explains the use of the fall-rise for **polite corrections**.
