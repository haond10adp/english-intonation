**Exclamations** (= expression of surprise, anger or excitement) virtually always have a **fall**. We call this tone **exclamatory fall**.
It can be seen as a sub-type of the definitive fall.

Some exclamations have a special grammatical function form. In English these begin with _what_ or _how_, and in writing usually have an exclamation mark:
<Naudio
sentence="*What a \pity! <br>
What a *good i\dea! <br>
*How \odd! <br>
What *pretty \eyes she has <br>
How *very \nice of him!"
nuclei="{['pit', 'dea', 'odd', 'eyes', 'nice']}"
/>
Other exclamations may be interjections, statements, or yes-no interrogatives. But they are all said with an exclamatory fall:
<Naudio
  sentence="\Wow! <br>
  \Dreadful! <br>
  I *don't be\lieve it! <br>
  *Welcome to \Brighton! <br>
  You were \marvelous, darling! <br>
  *Isn't she /pretty! <br>
  *Wasn't it \awful!"
  nuclei="{['Wow', 'Dread', 'lieve', 'Bright', 'mar', 'pret', 'awf']}" 
/>
<AudioWrapper>
<Audio 
  sentence="?? *Will you be going to Oak /Hill? <br> - *Will I \heck!" 
  nuclei="{['Hill', 'heck']}" 
  url="2-17" 
  start=3 
  end=7
/>
</AudioWrapper>
<Naudio
  sentence="?? He's *feeling a bit an\noyed. <br> - \Is he just!"
  nuclei="{['noyed', 'Is']}" 
/>

Exclamations are thus simplest kind of utterance for the student of EFL. The rule is: if it's an exclamation, say it with a fall. Exclamatory falls are excellent drill material for anyone who wants to practice producing falling tones. (It is not true that every sentence written with an exclamation mark necessarily takes a fall. In particular, commands (see [2.18](2.18)) may be written with an exclamation mark and pronounced with a fall-rise.)
