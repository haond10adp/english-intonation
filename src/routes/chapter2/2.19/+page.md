## Default tone

The categories of interjections and exclamation partly overlap. So, not surprisingly, the default tone for interjections is an exclamatory (or definitive) fall:
<Naudio
  sentence="\Thank you. <br> *Oh \good! <br> \Sure"
  nuclei="{['Thank', 'good', 'Sure']}" 
/>

## Encouraging rise

However, many short interjections can be said with an encouraging rise, inviting the other person to speak or to continue speaking:
<Naudio
  sentence="?? <em>(answering the phone)</em> <br> - Hul/lo. <br><br>
  ?? <em>(bank clerk to the next customer)</em> <br> - Good /morning. (How can I \help you? <br><br>
  ?? I've *bought a new \hat, darling. <br> - Uh&ndash;huh. (\Tell me about it.) <br><br>
  ?? Oh \/Mary. <br> - /Yes?"
  nuclei="{['lo', 'morn', 'help', 'hat', 'Tell', 'Mar', 'Yes']}" 
/>
The interjection oops, whoops (uttered when you have just made a mistake or dropped something seems always to have rise (including under 'rise' its variant, the mid level see [5.7](/chapter5/5.7)))

In other cases a rise on an interjection signals no more than a routine acknowledgement:
<Naudio
  sentence="?? Here's your \change, love <br> - /Thank you. <br><br>
  ?? You'll *need this \form. <br> - /Right."
  nuclei="{['change', 'Thank', 'form', 'Right']}" 
/>

## Definitive fall vs Encouraging rise

The difference in meaning between a definitive fall and an encouraging rise can be seen in the following pair of examples:
<AudioWrapper>
<Audio 
  sentence="?? (i) *Unscrew the \cylinder head. <br> - \Right. (I \will)" 
  nuclei="{['cyl', 'Right', 'will']}" 
  url="2-19" 
  start=2
  end=6
/>
<Audio 
  sentence="?? (ii) *Unscrew the \cylinder head. <br> - /Right. (And *what \next?)" 
  nuclei="{['cyl', 'Right', 'next']}" 
  url="2-19" 
  start=6
  end=10
/>
</AudioWrapper>
The fall on _right_ in (i) implies the potential completion of the conversational interchange, whereas the rise in (ii) can be taken by the first speaker as an invitation to issue a further conversation. It means something like 'please continue speaking'.

Not all encouraging rises on interjections means 'please continue speaking'. In the following examples the meaning is more 'please continue with your course of action':
<Naudio
  sentence="?? It's my e\xam | to/morrow. <br> *Good /luck! <br><br>
  ?? Would you *like me to do it /now? <br> *Yes /please."
  nuclei="{['xam', 'mor', 'luck', 'now', 'please']}" 
/>

### Calling someone by name

In calling someone by name, we normally use a rise or fall-rise if trying to get their attention. A fall, on the other hand, is a straightforward greeting (or, of course, an exclamation):
<Naudio
  sentence="Pro*fessor /Jones: | I *wonder if I could have a \word <br>
  Pro*fessor \/Jones: | I *wonder if I could have a \word <br>
  Pro*fessor \Jones! | How *nice to \see you! <br>
  /Peter? (Is *that you? || It's \me!)
  \Peter! (*Fancy seeing \you!)"
  nuclei="{['Jones', 'word', 'see', 'Pet', 'you', 'me']}" 
/>

## Greetings

For most **greetings**, both falls and rises are perfectly possible and acceptable. A definitive fall is more formal, an encouraging rise more personal:
<Naudio
  sentence="(i) Hel\lo! <br>
  (ii) Hel/lo. <br>
  (i) Good \morning <br>
  (ii) Good /morning."
  nuclei="{['lo', 'mor']}" 
/>
Variant (i), with a fall, means just 'I am greeting you', whereas variant (ii) , with a rise, expresses an added interest in the person addressed, 'as I greet you, I am acknowledging you'.

### Vocative after Hello or Hi

A vocative after _hello_ or _hi_ usually has its own rising tone (see [4.4](/chapter4/4.4)). In this case _hello_ may be stress-shifted (see [5.10](/chapter5/5.10)) so that the accent falls on the first syllable:
<Naudio
  sentence="\Hi, | /Kevin. <br>
  Hel\lo, | /Margaret <em>or</em> \Hello, | /Margaret. <br>
  Hul\lo, | /Tim. <em>or</em> \Hullo, | /Tim."
  nuclei="{['Hi', 'Kev', 'lo', 'Mar', 'Tim', 'Hul', 'Hel']}" 
/>
One or wo greetings are tonally restricted. Whereas _hello_ may have any tone,
_hi_ (if said with an ordinary tone, not stylized one; see [5.15](/chapter5/5.15)) can only have a fall. The same is true of _hey_. Likewise _cheers_, in its British sense of 'thank you', always has a fall:
<Naudio
  sentence="\Hi! <br>
  \Hi, Julia. <br>
  \Hi, | /Ashley. <br>
  \Hey, | \you! || I want to \talk to you. <br>
  \Cheers, mate"
  nuclei="{['Hi', 'Ash', 'Hey', 'you', 'talk', 'Cheers']}" 
/>

## Thank you

Said with fa fall, _thank you_ has the straightforward meaning ' I am thanking you'; with a rise, it suggests 'as I thank you, I am acknowledging you'. This is, however, a routine kind of acknowledgment. To express genuinely gratitude,
it is necessary to use af all, variant (i):
<Naudio
  sentence="\Thank you. (Straightforward) <br>
  /Thank you. (routine acknowledgement)"
  nuclei="{['Thank']}" 
/>

## Farewell

For saying **fare well**, _goodbye_ and its equivalents often have a rise. Since _good-bye_ signals the completion of a conversational exchange, you might expect it normally to be said with a definitive fall; but in practice a rise is much more frequent. Why? Because it is an encouraging rise, expressing good will and an acknowledgement of the other person. The same applies when a television presenter signs off.
<AudioWrapper>
<Audio 
  sentence="I'm \off | /now. || *Good /bye." 
  nuclei="{['off', 'now', 'bye']}" 
  url="2-19" 
  start=11
  end=13
/>
</AudioWrapper>
<Naudio
  sentence="*Good /night. || *See you to/morrow. <br>
  *So /long then. <br>
  *That's it from /me."
  nuclei="{['night', 'mor', 'long', 'me']}" 
/>
But to get rid of an unwelcome guest you would say:
<Naudio
  sentence="*Good\bye"
  nuclei="{['bye']}" 
/>
Strangely, the informal _see you_ tends to have a fall-rise rather than a rise:
<Naudio
  sentence="\/See you"
  nuclei="{['See']}" 
/>
